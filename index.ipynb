    "## 1. Background\n",
    "Financial institutions face increasing pressure to comply with stringent regulatory frameworks governing customer onboarding, Know Your Customer (KYC), Customer Due Diligence (CDD), Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD), Anti-Money Laundering (AML), Counter Terrorism Financing, Counter Proliferation Financing (CPF), and sanctions screening. These obligations are complex, continuously evolving, and vary across jurisdictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Staff often face difficulties accessing and interpreting regulatory documents and internal policies, leading to:\n",
    "-\tDelays in onboarding, affecting customer experience and revenue.\n",
    "-\tInconsistent application of compliance procedures.\n",
    "-\tOverdependence on compliance officers for basic guidance.\n",
    "-\tIncreased risk of regulatory breaches which may lead to fining by regulators and put the bank at risk of its license being suspended.\n",
