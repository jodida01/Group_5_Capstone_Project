ESCROW ACCOUNTS

An Escrow is a legal concept in which a financial instrument or an asset is held by a third party on behalf of two other parties that are in the process of completing a transaction. The funds or assets are held by the escrow agent until it receives the appropriate instructions or until predetermined contractual obligations are fulfilled. Money, securities, funds, and other assets can all be held in escrow. Examples include real estate transactions, banking, intellectual property, mergers and acquisitions, law and many others. Escrow accounts are opened for such purposes.

The Bank has applied the use of Escrow accounts in two main methods:

Customer Initiated Escrow Accounts:

These are escrow accounts, which are requested for by a customer in order to fulfil a third-party condition for a certain project. This escrow account will be closed upon completion of the project.

Example

In an IPO trade, a stockbroker may request the Bank to open an escrow account where prospective buyers will deposit funds for purchase of the IPO shares. Upon allocation of shares, the utilized funds are sent to the IPO issuer and refunds credited back to the customer.

Bank Initiated Escrow Accounts:

These are accounts opened by the Bank for collection or build-up of funds by a borrower in order to honor a periodic debt obligation e.g. weekly / monthly / quarterly / yearly loan repayment. The debt is recovered from the escrow account as and when the periodic schedule becomes due.

There are two types of Bank Initiated escrow accounts namely:

Settlement Accounts - Commonly used for collection of repayments from employers for scheme borrowers e.g. Personal Loans Checkoff schemes, Sacco Personal Loans

Business Escrow Accounts ‚Äì Used for business customers whereby, the borrower continuously deposits funds directly in the escrow account to cater for an upcoming debt obligation.

Escrow Account Management

Escrow Account Properties

Restricted access to the borrower or customer.

Loan schedules can hunt for funds in the Escrow Accounts.

Sweeping instructions/orders from transactional to escrow accounts are accepted.

Funds credited in an escrow account do not earn any interest.

STAFF ACCOUNTS

For staff posted to the Branch, the account opening shall be done at designated branch.

For staff posted to Head Office Departments, the account opening shall be done at Co-operative House Branch.

All other terms in respect to the operations of the accounts shall be as per the Staff Manual & the Bank Operating Manual.

Ex-staff Current Accounts

Staff who retire from the Bank continue enjoying similar account benefits to those of the existing staff under scheme code STCUR.

Upon demise of a staff member, the staff account to be retained under scheme code STCUR

A deceased staff current account with a debit balance will have debit interest rate zero-rated (0%) to stop accruing additional charges. However, an account with a credit balance to continue earning interest where applicable. HRD shall advise the respective Branch to close the account(s) upon final payment of the benefits.
